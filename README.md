# TechDaysNL-WebjobsSDK
Code used during the Webjobs SDK session @ TechDaysNL

Session abstract:
This session is about getting the most out of Microsoft's open-source WebjobsSDK which is also the heart of Azure Functions. Azure functions are incredibly powerful in your online environment. What about your on premise environment? Wouldn't you love to run small functions on your or your clients machines with nearly the same convenience? Learn how you can run and deploy small functions on premise in a plug-and-play manner without having to worry about provisioning and be able to communicate instantly with those machines by sending your custom commands to them and get quick responses out of them.
